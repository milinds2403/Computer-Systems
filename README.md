# Computer Systems

ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to a collection of my Computer Systems work! 

To see my recreation of the "Missile Command" game in x86 with a tasklet and an I/O controller, click here: https://github.com/milinds2403/x86-Missile-Command

To see the "adventure" game, where you explore the University of Illinois' campus, using a driver for a physical controller and a synchronous mechanism between the controller and keyboard to allow for user input, click here: https://github.com/milinds2403/Adventure-Game

To see the custom Linux-based operating system I built from scratch, has interrupt/global descriptor tables, system calls, video-mapping, EXT2 filesystem, scheduling algorithms, and virtualization/paging for user and kernel-specific tasks, click here: https://github.com/milinds2403/Custom-Operating-System
